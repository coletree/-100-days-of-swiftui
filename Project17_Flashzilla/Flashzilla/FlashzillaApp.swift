//In this project we’re going to build an app that helps users learn things using flashcards
//cards with one thing written on such as “to buy”, and another thing written on the other side, such as “comprar”.
//Of course, this is a digital app so we don’t need to worry about “the other side”,
//and can instead just make the detail for the flash card appear when it’s tapped.
